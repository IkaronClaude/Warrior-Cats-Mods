-- Prey follows the world (tickets.md 22): how much of each prey kind is around depends on the season - leaf-bare has
-- few mice and almost no squirrels (they keep to their nests), greenleaf is full of them. config/weather.ini
-- [Season.<Name>] Prey = Mice=0.7, Squirrel=0.2, ... (the share of each kind that is about; 1 = all, the default).
-- The game's generators keep spawning their prey as before; each roaming prey (BP_Exploration_Character_Base_C of a
-- prey kind) is rolled once per season when it appears or the season changes: an absent one is hidden, can't be
-- touched and its AI rests - never destroyed, so the generators don't respawn it over and over - and comes back
-- when a later season's roll has it about. Prey also comes and goes during the day (tickets.md 23, the "random times"
-- part): every in-game hour a share of the creatures (PreyTurnover) roll again, so a spot empty in the morning may
-- have a mouse by noon.
